        <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
    
        <p>
 I’m D.Prasanth, an enthusiastic and self-driven final-year B.Tech student specializing in Information Technology at Vignan Institute of Information Technology, Vizag. Over the past few years, I’ve cultivated a strong interest in full-stack web development and have worked on multiple real-world projects that reflect both my technical skills and creativity.
<br><br>
Some of my notable projects include “Pain Diagnoser,” a 3D AI-based health assistant using Three.js and Flask, “Medi Locator,” a pharmacy finder with live medicine suggestions and emergency services, “Movie Bro,” a genre-based movie recommendation platform, and “Inspect Future,” a student support portal with academic content and career roadmaps. These projects demonstrate my ability to take a concept from idea to deployment, all while prioritizing clean UI/UX and performance.
<br><br>
Beyond development, I’ve always been passionate about learning and problem-solving. I’ve solved over 150 problems on LeetCode, earned a 3-star rating on CodeChef, and completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. I’m also a ServiceNow Certified System Administrator (CSA), which reflects my curiosity and commitment to understanding industry-standard platforms.

            <h3>Web Developement</h3>
            <p>I have a strong foundation in full-stack web development, gained through hands-on project development. I've built and deployed several real-world applications using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Flask, and MongoDB. From designing responsive frontends to developing secure backend APIs, I’ve worked on every layer of the stack. My experience includes implementing user authentication, integrating third-party libraries, and managing databases efficiently. .

            <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
            <p>I have a strong foundation in data analytics, backed by the completion of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. Through this certification, I gained hands-on experience with tools and languages such as SQL, R, Python (Pandas), and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib. I’ve developed a solid understanding of the data analysis process — from data collection and cleaning to visualization and deriving actionable insights.</p>

            <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>I have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, which I’ve developed through consistent practice. I’ve solved over 150 problems on LeetCode and achieved a 3-star rating on CodeChef, which reflects my problem-solving abilities and logical thinking. My practice has covered a wide range of topics from easy to hard. This consistent exposure to algorithmic thinking has not only improved my coding efficiency but also strengthened my ability to approach real-world problems with optimized solutions.</p>
